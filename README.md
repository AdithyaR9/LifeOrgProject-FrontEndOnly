This is the Front-End only version of my Website, 'LifeOrg' (Life Organization). It is made with HTML, CSS (w/ Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

This website is meant to aid people in storing and calculating important data in their life
  - Finances
  - Immediate Errands and Important Tasks
  - Health data

Note: this is only the front-end version of the project, and as such, does not have database storage capabilites. All other functions work, although some changes have been implemented in the final, full-stack application.
